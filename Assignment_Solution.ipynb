    "In the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the \"pillars\" refer to the four fundamental principles that define and guide the design and implementation of classes and objects. These principles are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It is about hiding the internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through well-defined interfaces (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding, abstraction, and modularity. It protects the integrity of data by preventing accidental modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary parts to the user. It allows the user to interact with objects using high-level operations without worrying about internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Abstraction simplifies complex systems by modeling classes based on real-world entities and focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is the mechanism where a class (subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass or base class). It supports the concept of reusability and allows the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Inheritance promotes code reusability and enables the creation of specialized classes (subclasses) that inherit behaviors and attributes from more general classes (superclasses).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or behave differently based on the context. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, providing flexibility and enabling dynamic method dispatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Polymorphism enhances flexibility and extensibility by allowing the same interface (method signature) to be used for different types of objects. It supports method overriding and method overloading."
